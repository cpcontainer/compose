		<p>Method means which way the server is aquiring data from Dishy. Change inside congif.inc.php</p>
		<p><strong>BROWSER</strong> - Requires you to have a browser open and accessing the web app so that the server can read the stats. 
		This is simple but can cause issues if too many tabs are open viewing this.<br><br>
		Speedtest will not operate using this method. The more reliable and consistent method is CLI.</p>

		<p><strong>CLI</strong> - Uses cron jobs and hidden screen sessions to update the server. This runs all the time and will collect data even if you are not viewing the page.<br><br>
		
		In the scripts/binbash folder you will find two .sh files. You can modify them (path), and place them on your system. Run each one in a screen session.
		
		<br><br>
		The speedtest is found in script/cron/php/speedtest.cron.php.<br>Add that to your cron job.<br>Ex: */5 * * * * php /your/install/path/here/speedtest.cron.php.<br><br>
		Please do not run every minute. Be kind to Sats and Servers
